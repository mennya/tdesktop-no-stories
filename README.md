# Telegram Desktop — No Stories

Personal Windows x64 fork of Telegram Desktop, based on upstream **v7.3.5**.
It keeps messaging available while reducing visual distractions and allowing
selected chats to stay quiet.

## What this fork changes

- **No Stories:** hides the story strip, rings, profile sections and entry points.
  Forwarded or shared stories become a non-interactive placeholder; story links
  do not produce a story preview or open the story viewer. Ordinary messages,
  attachments and live broadcasts remain available.
- **No birthday setup reminder:** hides the prompt to add your own birthday.
  Other people's birthdays and normal profile editing remain available.
- **No Windows unread indicators:** removes unread numbers, muted grey badges
  and the monochrome dot from the tray and taskbar. Tray tooltips, window titles
  and active-chat taskbar labels also omit unread counts.
- **Still emoji beside names:** name emoji and emoji-status decorations use a
  static first frame. Emoji, stickers and reactions inside messages retain their
  normal animations.
- **No recording controls:** removes the microphone and round-video buttons from
  empty composers and disables their recording shortcuts. Text sending, editing,
  scheduling, attachments and playback of received voice messages remain.
- **Stable contact avatars:** other ordinary people show initials unless you set
  a personal contact photo. Your chosen picture remains static and syncs through
  Telegram. Deleting it returns to initials. Original profile photos, galleries
  and avatar click-to-open are hidden for these contacts. Your own avatar, bots,
  groups, channels and service icons keep their existing behavior; photos in
  messages still open normally.
- **Strict mute:** an optional local setting for a private chat or whole group,
  with confirmation both when enabling and disabling it.
  It suppresses that chat's notifications, sounds, attention badges, mentions,
  reaction alerts and incoming-call popups/ringing. Calls are not automatically
  declined. Its unread messages do not contribute to displayed chat, folder or
  account counters, and incoming activity does not move its anchored position in
  the chat list. A small static lock-and-mute mark appears beside the name or
  over the avatar in the icon-only list, even when Telegram's optional ordinary
  mute icon is disabled.

Strict mute is stored separately for each account on this device; it does not
change server mute settings, read receipts or another client's behavior. Messages
remain available when you open the chat. Turning strict mute off restores the
actual unread counts and normal sorting without replaying old alerts. Ordinary
chat counters and notifications retain their normal behavior outside strict mute.
If Telegram has not yet supplied enough data to exclude a strict-muted chat from
the archive total, the unresolved archive badge stays hidden until it can be
computed accurately; unrelated chats keep their own counters.

## Installation and updates

Use this fork's portable ZIP or installer. They keep account data in a separate
`TelegramForcePortable` directory, independently of an official Telegram install.
Do not install over the official client or import its session files.

Packages are **unsigned** and official automatic updates are disabled. To update,
close this fork completely, install the new fork package into the same location
or replace the portable program files, and preserve `TelegramForcePortable`.
Building production packages requires your own Telegram API credentials.

See [build, packaging and verification instructions](docs/building-no-stories.md).
The feature list describes the intended behavior; a compiler pass alone does not
establish interactive acceptance of a new build.

The original project's documentation follows. Its download links are official
upstream builds and do not contain this fork's changes.
